Supplementary Materials

These supplementary materials support the analyses reported in Validating Lemma-Based Frequency Bands in Spanish Through Morphological Complexity. All materials are publicly available in a GitHub repository to facilitate transparency and reproducibility.

Repository Access

The full set of data, scripts, and outputs is available at:

https://github.com/drmattpettus/spanish-lemma-frequency-bands

Contents

The repository includes the following components:

Frequency Data

Raw frequency data from the SUBTLEX-ESP subtitle corpus

Final lemma-based frequency bands used in the analyses

Morphological Data

Paradigm size estimates for each lemma derived from the Spanish AnCora treebank

Scripts

Scripts to construct lemma-based frequency bands

Scripts to compute descriptive and inferential statistics

Scripts to perform qualitative sanity checks

Results

Summary statistics corresponding to Table 1 in the article

Statistical test outputs reported in the Results section

Reproducibility

All analyses can be reproduced by executing the scripts in numerical order. File naming conventions and output formats correspond directly to those referenced in the main text.
